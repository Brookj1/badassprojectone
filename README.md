The Problem:
People are confined to the specific software their library uses to search for downloadable content.
Current software is cumbersome, and it can be difficult to navigate.
If you hold cards at multiple libraries you have to do multiple searches, which can also become confusing and time-consuming. 
There’s often large hold lists for titles and this page offers an efficient solution to see which titles are available.

Target Audience:
People who consume books and audio books in digital format.
People who are mobile / not confined to one library system.
Students looking for research material.
People who do not want to rely on paid subscription services to access e-books, e-audiobooks, and other electronic materials.

Solution:
Create a meta search of e-books and e-audiobooks across a variety of library collections.

Reality:
Overdrive and RB Digital (e-book/e-audiobook subscription services for libraries) did not provide API keys and require authentication, which is beyond the scope and timeframe for project 1. 
Instead of pursuing the original format of the project, we created a front-end concept prototype using Open Library and Digital Public Library of America APIs to search across digital collections. 

How it works:
A one-stop search for a title in Open Library and/or Digital Public Library of America and see a list of items in their collection.

Future:
Next iteration would require authentication through Overdrive and RB Digital to use their APIs.
Searchable collections would include libraries in the Denver Metro area, with possible expansion to other regional libraries.
More robust searching and filtering.
Availability of items and link to record for further interaction (place hold, check out, etc.)
